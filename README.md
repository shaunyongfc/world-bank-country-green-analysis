# world-bank-country-green-analysis

This is a Data Science project aiming to analyse the efforts of each country in green technology and energy.

This project consists of

- Getting the data from World Bank
- Updating the data when available without duplicated downloads
- Exploring the data by processing the features and generating new features
- Presenting charts of main findings using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/WorldBankGreenAnalysis/GreenhouseGasesEmissionAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Tentatively I will do more research to refine on the findings or to choose better indicators to do a better analysis.
